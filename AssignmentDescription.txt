For this assignment you are going to add access modifiers to the properties and methods of the BegInheritance classes, so that it is properly encapsulated.
You also need to add JavaDoc comments to the methods of the classes. 



BegInheritance assignment Description for reference:
/////////////////////////////////
For this assignment you are going to make 3 classes.  The Student class and the Teacher class should extend from the Person class. 
Below you will find a list of properties and methods and constructors that the Student and Teacher class should have it is your job
to figure out what can actually be put in the Person class so that you are not duplicating code in the Student and Teacher.

When you submit to mimir it will use my "Main" class to test your classes to make sure they do what they are supposed to.  Make sure
that your methods and classes are spelled the same as listed below (case sensitive).  Mimir will not check to make sure if everyting is
setup to be properly inherited so it will be hand check and entered as part of the grade during the explanation.

////////////////////////////
Student
//properties
-firstName -(String)
-lastName  -(String)
-phoneNumber -(long)
-daysTardy - (int)
-daysAbsent - (int)
-username -(String)
-schoolGrade  - (int) 

//Constructor
should accept parameters for (firstName,lastName,phoneNumber,username and schoolGrade) and set accordingly
(call the base/parent/super constructor to set properties that are part of the base/parent/super class),
daysAbsent and daysTardy should be initialized to 0;

//methods
--getSchoolGrade()   -  should return the schoolGrade property
--getDaysTardy()  - should return the daysTardy property
--getDaysAbsent()  - should return the daysAbsent property
--getContactInfo()  - should return :  "first name: " + firstName + " last name: " + lastName + " phone number: " + phoneNumber
--getUsername()  - should return the username property
--markTardy()  -  should add 1 to daysTardy and return nothing
--markAbsent() - should add 1 to daysAbsent and return nothing


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Teacher

//properties
-first Name - (String)
-lastName  - (String)
-phoneNumber  - (long)
-classTaught  - (String)
-username  - (String)
-yearsTaught  - (int)

//Constructor 
should accept parameters (firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, username, classTaught, yearsTaught) for all values and set accordingly
(call the base/parent/super constructor to set properties that are part of the base/parent class)

//Methods
--getYearsTaught()  - should return the yearsTaught property
--getClassTaught()  - should return the classTaught property
--getContactInfo()  -  should return : "first name: " + firstName + " last name: " + lastName + " phone number: " + phoneNumber
--getUsername() - should return the username property

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Person
- This is to be used as the base class for Teacher/Student and based on the above descriptions of Student and Teacher you decide what goes in Person.
